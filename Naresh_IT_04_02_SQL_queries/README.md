# Naresh_IT_04_02_SQL_queries

This repository focuses on mastering SQL through practical query writing. It covers the core SQL commands that data analysts, engineers, and data scientists use to retrieve, filter, and aggregate data from relational databases. The emphasis here is on hands-on query practice using real-world patterns, not just syntax memorization.

In this module, we:

- Learn how to use `SELECT`, `FROM`, `WHERE`, `GROUP BY`, `ORDER BY`, and `HAVING` effectively
- Explore filtering using logical operators, pattern matching (`LIKE`, `IN`), and NULL handling
- Perform aggregations using functions like `SUM()`, `AVG()`, `COUNT()`, `MAX()`, and `MIN()`
- Write joins across multiple tables using `INNER JOIN`, `LEFT JOIN`, and `RIGHT JOIN`
- Create nested queries and subqueries for multi-step logic
- Practice with structured examples and common business use cases

This repo is ideal for those looking to:

- Strengthen their SQL foundation for data analytics and BI roles
- Practice translating data problems into efficient SQL queries
- Build confidence in joining, filtering, and summarizing data from multiple tables
- Prepare for interviews or case studies involving SQL-based data exploration
- Develop muscle memory for clean, readable, and optimized SQL code
