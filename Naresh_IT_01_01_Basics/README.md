# Naresh_IT_01_01_Basics

This repository serves as the foundational starting point for learning **Full Stack Data Science & GenAI**, based on the Naresh IT curriculum. It includes hands-on notebooks, notes, and exercises designed to build a strong understanding of Python basics for data science and AI applications.

In this module, we:

- Cover the core Python concepts required for data science and GenAI
- Practice basic syntax, data types, functions, and control flow
- Introduce the Jupyter Notebook environment for experimentation
- Lay the groundwork for more advanced topics like pandas, NumPy, and machine learning

This repo is ideal for those looking to:

- Get started with Python in a data science context
- Transition into GenAI or machine learning roles
- Build coding confidence through hands-on practice
- Follow a structured learning path mapped to industry needs
