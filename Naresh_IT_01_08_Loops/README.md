# Naresh_IT_01_08_Loops

This repository focuses on **looping constructs in Python**, which are essential for automating repetitive tasks and processing data efficiently. As part of the Full Stack Data Science & GenAI curriculum (Naresh IT), this module covers `for` and `while` loops with hands-on examples and exercises.

In this module, we:

- Learn the syntax and usage of `for` and `while` loops
- Explore iteration over sequences like lists, strings, and ranges
- Use `break`, `continue`, and `pass` to control loop behavior
- Understand nested loops and their practical applications
- Solve practice problems to reinforce loop-based thinking

This repo is ideal for those looking to:

- Automate repetitive operations in Python
- Strengthen their understanding of flow control in real-world coding
- Build confidence in writing efficient loops and avoiding common pitfalls
- Prepare for more advanced tasks involving data traversal and transformation
