# Naresh_IT_01_06_Pandas_&_Seaborn

This repository combines practical data manipulation with **pandas** and advanced data visualization using **Seaborn**. It is part of the Full Stack Data Science & GenAI curriculum (Naresh IT) and focuses on performing exploratory data analysis (EDA) with clarity and visual storytelling.

In this module, we:

- Apply pandas techniques to clean, transform, and explore datasets
- Use grouping, aggregation, and filtering to prepare data for visualization
- Create visually appealing and informative plots using Seaborn
- Work with Seaborn plots like countplot, boxplot, violinplot, heatmap, and pairplot
- Integrate pandas and Seaborn to analyze real-world datasets end-to-end

This repo is ideal for those looking to:

- Perform effective exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- Combine data manipulation and visualization in Python workflows
- Understand relationships, distributions, and trends within data
- Build a strong foundation for data-driven storytelling and reporting
