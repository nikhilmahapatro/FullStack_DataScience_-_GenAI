# Naresh_IT_01_03_DataStructures

This repository covers the key **built-in data structures in Python**, forming the backbone of data handling in any data science or GenAI project. It is part of the Full Stack Data Science & GenAI series based on the Naresh IT curriculum.

In this module, we:

- Learn about Pythonâ€™s core data structures: Lists, Tuples, Sets, and Dictionaries
- Understand their properties, use cases, and performance differences
- Practice common operations like insertion, deletion, iteration, and lookup
- Solve practical problems using each data structure
- Lay the foundation for working with complex data in tools like pandas and NumPy

This repo is ideal for those looking to:

- Develop a solid understanding of Python data structures
- Write cleaner, more efficient code for data manipulation
- Build the skills necessary for real-world data processing tasks
- Prepare for interviews and coding assessments in data science roles
