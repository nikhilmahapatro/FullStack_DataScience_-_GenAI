# Naresh_IT_01_03_DataStructures

This repository covers the key built-in data structures in Python, forming the backbone of data handling in any data science or GenAI project. It is part of the Full Stack Data Science & GenAI series based on the Naresh IT curriculum.

In this module, we:

- Learn about Pythonâ€™s core data structures: Lists, Tuples, Sets, and Dictionaries
- Understand their properties, mutability, and performance implications
- Perform common operations like appending, indexing, updating, deleting, and iteration
- Apply data structures to solve practical problems and logic-based challenges
- Explore use cases such as sets for deduplication, dictionaries for data mapping, and lists for storing sequences

This repo is ideal for those looking to:

- Write clean, efficient code for data manipulation
- Build the skills necessary for real-world data cleaning and analysis
- Understand how to store, access, and transform structured data
- Prepare for coding assessments involving basic logic and structure selection
