# Naresh_IT_08_03_MultiLinearRegression

This repository introduces Multiple Linear Regression, an essential technique in supervised machine learning. It models the relationship between two or more independent variables and one continuous dependent variable. The focus here is on building intuition, implementing the model, checking assumptions, and evaluating results.

In this module, we:

- Understand the general equation of a multivariable regression line: `y = b₀ + b₁x₁ + b₂x₂ + ... + bₙxₙ`
- Learn how to fit a multi-feature model using Ordinary Least Squares
- Use sklearn’s `LinearRegression` to train and evaluate multiple linear regression models
- Check for multicollinearity using correlation heatmaps and Variance Inflation Factor (VIF)
- Visualize predictions and residuals using matplotlib and seaborn
- Evaluate model performance using MSE, RMSE, MAE, and R² Score
- Interpret coefficients to understand feature impact in real-world scenarios

This repo is ideal for those looking to:

- Build a solid foundation in multiple regression modeling
- Learn how to work with datasets containing multiple features
- Detect and address multicollinearity issues in predictors
- Improve performance evaluation and interpretation of regression results
- Prepare for interviews and academic questions related to multivariate analysis
- Strengthen Python + sklearn + pandas + seaborn skills in a real ML workflow
