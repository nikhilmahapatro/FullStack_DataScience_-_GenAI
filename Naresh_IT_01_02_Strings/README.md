# Naresh_IT_01_02_Strings

This repository focuses on mastering string handling in Python, which is an essential skill for any data science or GenAI project. It is part of the Full Stack Data Science & GenAI curriculum inspired by Naresh ITâ€™s structured learning modules.

In this module, we:

- Explore Python strings and their properties
- Practice slicing, indexing, concatenation, and formatting
- Use built-in string methods like `split()`, `replace()`, `strip()`, `lower()`, `find()` and more
- Solve real-world problems using string manipulation and pattern matching
- Understand the role of strings in data preprocessing, NLP, and feature extraction

This repo is ideal for those looking to:

- Strengthen their understanding of Python strings through hands-on practice
- Clean and transform textual data for analytics or machine learning
- Prepare for data cleaning and tokenization tasks in NLP pipelines
- Build a strong Python foundation for future modules like pandas and regular expressions
