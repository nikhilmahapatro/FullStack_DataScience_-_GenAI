# Naresh_IT_08_01_DataPreprocessing

This repository focuses on **data preprocessing techniques essential for cleaning and preparing data** before analysis or modeling. As part of the Full Stack Data Science & GenAI curriculum (Naresh IT), this module walks through common preprocessing steps with practical examples.

In this module, we:

- Handle missing values with imputation and removal methods  
- Encode categorical variables using label encoding and one-hot encoding  
- Scale and normalize numerical features  
- Detect and treat outliers  
- Split datasets for training and testing purposes

This repo is ideal for those who want to:

- Build reliable data pipelines by ensuring data quality  
- Understand practical preprocessing workflows used in real projects  
- Prepare datasets effectively for machine learning algorithms  
- Gain hands-on experience with pandas and sklearn preprocessing tools
