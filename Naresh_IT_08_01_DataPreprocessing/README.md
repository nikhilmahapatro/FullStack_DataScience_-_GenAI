# Naresh_IT_08_01_DataPreprocessing

This repository covers data preprocessing â€” the critical first step in any machine learning pipeline. Clean and well-prepared data significantly improves model accuracy, performance, and generalization. This module focuses on transforming raw, messy data into a structured and usable format.

In this module, we:

- Handle missing data using techniques like imputation (mean/median/mode) and deletion
- Deal with duplicates and outliers using statistical thresholds
- Encode categorical variables using Label Encoding and One-Hot Encoding
- Apply feature scaling methods such as StandardScaler and MinMaxScaler
- Convert data types and parse dates where needed
- Split data into train/test sets and prepare it for modeling

This repo is ideal for those looking to:

- Learn the practical techniques used to clean and prepare real-world datasets
- Build pipelines that feed consistent, high-quality data into ML models
- Understand the impact of preprocessing on model performance and evaluation
- Avoid common mistakes like data leakage or improper scaling
- Gain confidence working with pandas and sklearn preprocessing tools in tandem
