# Naresh_IT_04_01_SQL_vs_Python

This repository explores the practical comparison between SQL and Python for data extraction, transformation, and analysis. It highlights how both tools handle similar tasks like filtering, grouping, and joining â€” allowing data professionals to choose the right tool for the right context. This module is particularly useful for those transitioning from database querying to full-scale data science.

In this module, we:

- Compare SQL queries with their equivalent pandas code in Python
- Learn how filtering, grouping, aggregation, and joins are handled in both approaches
- Analyze the strengths and limitations of SQL and Python for different stages of the data pipeline
- Translate real-world data tasks (e.g., customer segmentation, sales analysis) across both tools
- Understand when SQL is better suited for raw data extraction and when Python offers more flexibility for manipulation and modeling

This repo is ideal for those looking to:

- Build fluency in both SQL and Python as data analysis tools
- Transition from database querying to more advanced data processing in Python
- Understand how to replicate SQL logic using pandas and vice versa
- Strengthen interviews and workplace readiness by knowing both perspectives
- Develop a hybrid skill set that supports end-to-end data workflows
