# Naresh_IT_04_01_SQL_vs_Python

This repository compares **SQL and Python for data manipulation and analysis**. As part of the Full Stack Data Science & GenAI curriculum (Naresh IT), this module walks through key differences, strengths, and use cases of both tools.

In this module, we:

- Explore basic SQL queries for filtering, joining, and aggregating data  
- Perform similar operations using Python libraries like pandas  
- Compare syntax, flexibility, and performance aspects  
- Understand when to use SQL, when Python, and how they can complement each other  
- Solve practice problems to strengthen both SQL and Python skills

This repo is ideal for those who want to:

- Gain fluency in both SQL and Python for data tasks  
- Understand the trade-offs between querying data in databases vs. in-memory analysis  
- Build a versatile toolkit for handling diverse data scenarios  
- Prepare for real-world projects requiring smooth transitions between SQL and Python workflows
