# Naresh_IT_08_02_SimpleLinearRegression

This repository covers the fundamentals of **simple linear regression**, a core technique in supervised machine learning. As part of the Full Stack Data Science & GenAI curriculum (Naresh IT), this module explains theory and provides practical implementation using Python.

In this module, we:

- Understand the concept of linear regression and its assumptions  
- Learn how to fit a simple linear regression model to data  
- Evaluate model performance using metrics like R-squared and RMSE  
- Visualize regression lines and residuals  
- Apply regression for prediction tasks with real datasets

This repo is ideal for those who want to:

- Grasp the basics of regression analysis  
- Build and interpret simple predictive models  
- Prepare for more advanced machine learning topics  
- Gain hands-on coding experience with libraries like scikit-learn and matplotlib
