# Naresh_IT_08_02_SimpleLinearRegression

This repository introduces Simple Linear Regression, one of the most fundamental algorithms in supervised machine learning. It models the relationship between a single independent variable and a continuous dependent variable using a straight line. The focus here is on building intuition, implementing the model, and interpreting the results.

In this module, we:

- Understand the mathematical equation of a line: `y = mx + c`
- Learn how to fit a line to data by minimizing error (Ordinary Least Squares)
- Use sklearn's `LinearRegression` to train and test models
- Visualize regression lines and residuals using matplotlib and seaborn
- Evaluate model performance using metrics like MSE, RMSE, and RÂ² Score
- Interpret slope and intercept in the context of real-world scenarios

This repo is ideal for those looking to:

- Build a solid foundation in linear modeling and regression analysis
- Learn how to apply and evaluate predictive models for numeric targets
- Understand overfitting and underfitting in the context of linear models
- Prepare for interviews and academic questions around regression
- Strengthen Python + sklearn + matplotlib skills in a practical ML setting
