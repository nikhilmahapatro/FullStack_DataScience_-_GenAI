# Naresh_IT_06_01_Gradio

This repository introduces Gradio, a fast and intuitive Python library that lets you build interactive web UIs for machine learning models, data science tools, and GenAI applications. It allows you to turn Python functions into shareable demos with just a few lines of code.

In this module, we:

- Learn the fundamentals of creating a Gradio app using `Interface`, `Blocks`, and `ChatInterface`
- Build quick interactive GUIs for models, calculators, image processors, and LLM agents
- Work with various input/output types like `Textbox`, `Slider`, `Dropdown`, `Image`, and `Chatbot`
- Handle multiple inputs and outputs, chaining functions with `Blocks`
- Host local and public Gradio apps with real-time interactivity
- Explore how Gradio supports AI explainability and human-AI collaboration

This repo is ideal for those looking to:

- Rapidly prototype and test ML or GenAI projects with real users
- Add simple, usable frontends to Python-based tools or functions
- Build Streamlit-style interactive UIs but with more flexibility for AI pipelines
- Share ML demos, visualizations, or GenAI experiments with stakeholders or online
- Gain experience building user-facing apps without frontend coding
