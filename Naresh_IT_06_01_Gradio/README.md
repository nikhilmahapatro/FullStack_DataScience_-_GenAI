# Naresh_IT_06_01_Gradio

This repository covers the basics of **building interactive machine learning and data science apps using Gradio**. Part of the Full Stack Data Science & GenAI curriculum (Naresh IT), this module offers hands-on examples to create quick, user-friendly interfaces with minimal code.

In this module, we:

- Learn to set up and launch Gradio apps  
- Explore core components like input widgets, output displays, and layouts  
- Build interactive demos for models and data processing pipelines  
- Understand how to customize UI elements and handle user inputs  
- Practice deploying Gradio apps locally and on cloud platforms

This repo is ideal for those looking to:

- Quickly prototype ML/DL model demos without front-end expertise  
- Share interactive tools with stakeholders or clients  
- Add user interaction to data science workflows  
- Gain practical experience with a popular Python app framework
