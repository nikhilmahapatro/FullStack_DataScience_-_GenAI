# Naresh_IT_01_05_Matplotlib

This repository introduces **Matplotlib**, Pythonâ€™s core library for creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations. As part of the Full Stack Data Science & GenAI curriculum (Naresh IT), this module focuses on building basic to intermediate plots for data exploration and communication.

In this module, we:

- Understand the structure and components of a Matplotlib plot
- Learn to create line plots, bar charts, scatter plots, histograms, and pie charts
- Customize plots using titles, labels, legends, colors, and grid lines
- Explore subplots and figure configuration for dashboard-style layouts
- Practice visualizing real-world data with meaningful insights

This repo is ideal for those looking to:

- Get started with data visualization using Python
- Build clear and informative plots for presentations and EDA
- Customize plots for better storytelling and readability
- Prepare for more advanced tools like Seaborn and Plotly
