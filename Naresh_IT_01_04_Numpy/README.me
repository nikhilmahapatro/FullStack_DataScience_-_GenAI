# Naresh_IT_01_04_Numpy

This repository introduces **NumPy (Numerical Python)**, one of the most essential libraries in the Python ecosystem for high-performance numerical computing. NumPy is at the core of almost every data science, machine learning, and GenAI workflow. It offers powerful data structures like multi-dimensional arrays (ndarrays) and provides a rich collection of functions for efficient mathematical operations.

This module is part of the Full Stack Data Science & GenAI curriculum based on Naresh IT’s structured learning path. It helps bridge the gap between core Python and more advanced data manipulation libraries like pandas.

In this module, we:

- Understand the limitations of native Python lists for numerical computation
- Learn how to create and manipulate 1D, 2D, and multi-dimensional NumPy arrays
- Explore array slicing, indexing, and reshaping techniques
- Perform mathematical operations using built-in NumPy functions
- Apply broadcasting rules to handle operations between arrays of different shapes
- Use aggregate functions (mean, sum, min, max, std, etc.) for quick analysis
- Understand memory efficiency and performance advantages of using NumPy
- Work with special arrays (zeros, ones, arange, linspace, identity)
- Learn basic linear algebra operations (dot product, matrix multiplication)

This repo is ideal for those looking to:

- Develop a strong foundation in numerical programming with Python
- Work with structured numerical data in machine learning, deep learning, or data analytics
- Understand the internal workings of libraries like pandas, SciPy, scikit-learn, and TensorFlow
- Improve performance when dealing with large-scale computations
- Transition smoothly into more complex GenAI and data science workflows

By mastering NumPy, you unlock a fast, flexible, and powerful way of working with numerical data — a key skill in any modern data-driven career.
