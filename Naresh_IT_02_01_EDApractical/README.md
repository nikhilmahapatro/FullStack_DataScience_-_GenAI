This repository focuses on hands-on Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), one of the most essential phases in any data science project. It builds on earlier modules by applying concepts from pandas, Seaborn, and Matplotlib to analyze real-world datasets and derive insights. The emphasis here is not just on code, but on interpreting what the data is telling us.

In this module, we:

- Perform data cleaning tasks like handling missing values, duplicates, and outliers
- Use descriptive statistics and summary methods to understand distributions and data types
- Create univariate, bivariate, and multivariate visualizations using Seaborn and Matplotlib
- Identify correlations, class imbalances, and relationships between features
- Use groupby and pivot techniques for segmented analysis
- Draw practical, business-relevant conclusions from data patterns

This repo is ideal for those looking to:

- Strengthen their ability to explore data independently and thoroughly
- Practice real-world EDA workflows that precede machine learning
- Improve their storytelling and interpretation using data visualizations
- Build project-ready notebooks that communicate insights clearly
- Prepare for interview questions involving insight generation or feature selection
