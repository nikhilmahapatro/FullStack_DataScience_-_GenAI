# Naresh_IT_02_01_EDApractical

This repository focuses on **exploratory data analysis (EDA) techniques in Python**, essential for understanding and preparing data before building models. As part of the Full Stack Data Science & GenAI curriculum (Naresh IT), this module covers practical EDA steps with hands-on examples and exercises.

In this module, we:

- Perform data cleaning like handling missing values and correcting data types  
- Generate visualizations such as histograms, box plots, scatter plots, and correlation heatmaps  
- Calculate summary statistics and explore data distributions  
- Work with sample datasets to practice step-by-step data analysis

This repo is ideal for those looking to:

- Understand the core principles of EDA and its role in data science projects  
- Gain hands-on experience with Python libraries like pandas, matplotlib, and seaborn  
- Build skills to identify patterns, anomalies, and insights in raw data  
- Prepare data effectively for downstream modeling and decision-making
