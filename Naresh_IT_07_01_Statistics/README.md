# Naresh_IT_07_01_Statistics

This repository introduces core concepts in statistics tailored for data science. It forms the mathematical backbone of data-driven decision making, model building, and hypothesis testing. The emphasis here is on practical understanding — not just theory — with examples relevant to analytics and machine learning workflows.

In this module, we:

- Learn types of data (qualitative vs quantitative) and levels of measurement
- Understand concepts like mean, median, mode, range, variance, and standard deviation
- Explore distributions including uniform, binomial, and normal
- Visualize data using histograms, boxplots, and density plots
- Study probability basics and how they relate to statistical thinking
- Get introduced to correlation, skewness, and kurtosis
- Lay the foundation for future topics like hypothesis testing and inferential statistics

This repo is ideal for those looking to:

- Build a strong statistical foundation for data science and ML
- Understand how data behaves before applying models
- Strengthen intuition around variability, central tendency, and probability
- Interpret visualizations and summary stats meaningfully
- Prepare for interview questions involving data insights and metric reasoning
