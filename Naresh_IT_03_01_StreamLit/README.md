# Naresh_IT_03_01_StreamLit

This repository introduces Streamlit, a powerful Python framework for building interactive web applications. This module focuses on helping data science learners quickly convert Python scripts, notebooks, and models into user-friendly interfaces without needing front-end development skills.

In this module, we:

- Learn the basics of creating Streamlit apps with simple Python code
- Use core Streamlit components such as `st.title()`, `st.text_input()`, `st.slider()`, and `st.button()`
- Build apps that respond to user input and update outputs dynamically
- Display dataframes, charts, and media elements directly in a browser
- Create practical tools such as form apps, small calculators, and data visualizers
- Understand how Streamlit integrates with machine learning workflows

This repo is ideal for those looking to:

- Convert Python-based data science tools into interactive web applications
- Rapidly prototype and deploy data apps for end-users or clients
- Practice frontend interaction logic without learning HTML, CSS, or JS
- Build a portfolio of real-time dashboards, tools, and microservices
- Transition from analysis to productization in data science workflows
