# Naresh_IT_08_04_Regularization

This repository introduces **Regularization in Linear Regression**, a key technique for reducing overfitting and improving model generalization. When a model becomes too complex, it may perform well on training data but fail to make accurate predictions on new, unseen data. Regularization tackles this by adding a penalty to large coefficient values, encouraging simpler, more robust models. This module focuses on implementing and comparing **Ridge**, **Lasso**, and **ElasticNet** using sklearn.

In this module, we:

- Understand how overfitting affects regression models and why regularization matters
- Explore the mathematical intuition behind:
  - Ridge Regression (L2 penalty)
  - Lasso Regression (L1 penalty)
  - ElasticNet (combined L1 and L2)
- Use sklearn’s `Ridge`, `Lasso`, and `ElasticNet` classes to train and evaluate models
- Compare regularized models to plain Linear Regression
- Analyze coefficient shrinkage and feature selection effects
- Visualize model performance using residual plots and coefficient paths
- Evaluate models using metrics like MSE, RMSE, MAE, and R² Score
- Tune regularization strength (`alpha`) to balance bias and variance

This repo is ideal for those looking to:

- Understand the practical benefits of regularization in regression
- Learn the difference between L1 and L2 penalties, and when to use them
- Apply Ridge and Lasso to real datasets and interpret the results
- Detect and reduce overfitting using model evaluation metrics
- Strengthen Python + sklearn + pandas + seaborn skills in a modeling pipeline
- Prepare for interviews or projects involving high-dimensional or noisy data
