# FullStack_DataScience_-_GenAI

This repository is a complete learning and project workspace for mastering **Full Stack Data Science and Generative AI (GenAI)** from the ground up. The structure is based on the Naresh IT curriculum, supplemented with practical modules, hands-on notebooks, and real-world implementations. It is designed for learners who want to build a strong foundation in both traditional data science and modern GenAI tools.

In this repository, we:

- Follow a structured progression of topics, from Python fundamentals to machine learning and GenAI
- Include notebooks, notes, exercises, and mini-projects for each module
- Cover core areas like data structures, NumPy, pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and basic statistics
- Introduce model building, evaluation metrics, and the machine learning pipeline
- Begin integrating GenAI-focused content in parallel (in progress)
- Organize each topic into its own subfolder with a consistent format and learning flow

This repo is ideal for those looking to:

- Build end-to-end proficiency in Python for data science
- Understand core data manipulation and visualization libraries through practice
- Gain confidence with foundational machine learning algorithms and evaluation
- Transition from traditional data science into Generative AI workflows
- Develop the skills needed to work on real-world projects and build a strong technical portfolio
- Learn at their own pace with a curated, sequential module-by-module structure
