# Naresh_IT_01_07_ConditionalStatements

This repository covers the fundamentals of **conditional statements in Python**, a core programming concept used to control the flow of logic in any application. As part of the Full Stack Data Science & GenAI curriculum (Naresh IT), this module focuses on writing decision-making code using `if`, `else`, and `elif`.

In this module, we:

- Understand the syntax and structure of conditional statements in Python
- Learn how to apply `if`, `else`, and `elif` in various scenarios
- Practice nesting conditions and using logical operators (`and`, `or`, `not`)
- Build basic decision-based programs to reinforce conditional logic
- Explore real-world applications where conditionals are essential in data pipelines

This repo is ideal for those looking to:

- Master the building blocks of control flow in Python
- Write logic-driven scripts and automate basic decision-making tasks
- Strengthen their coding foundation before moving to loops and functions
- Prepare for coding interviews or technical tests involving Python logic
